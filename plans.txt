dnd ideas

-private messages ie whispers
-turn based combat
-format to create spells
-modifiers- very important
-generate encounters of all kinds - combat, trading, interactions
-good if loot is auto generated at random - categories, value ect.


also return the severities and stuff to the dm for story telling

everything always needs to report info to the dm and the players if appropriate

the server needs to store a list of all items, weapons, spells and such, so that once one is made it can be easily used again later,
this would help with the auto generated loot as you could just add them all at once

saving each character as a file would be good, have the dm have one and the player another, so people could join others games
then the game state could also be saved and given out, so items can be created and shared

make a help guide to using the site, should be generally accessible

limit the number of items a store stocks

add a looting feature and make it whoever gets it first gets the loot

have buttons for saving throws
